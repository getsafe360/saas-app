## Performance Analysis

### Summary

Rumler.com is moderately performant (Lighthouse: 57 mobile/79 desktop) but falls short of key Core Web Vitals, especially on mobile. Main bottlenecks are unoptimized images, heavy JavaScript/CSS, render-blocking assets, and sub-optimal mobile UX.

### Key Metrics

| Metric                | Mobile         | Desktop         | Target (Google)        |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)   | 3.5s           | 2.7s            | < 2.5s                 |
| First Contentful Paint (FCP)     | 2.9s           | 1.7s            | < 1.8s                 |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)    | 0.18           | 0.18            | < 0.10                 |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT)        | 600ms          | 300ms           | < 200ms                |
| Page Weight                      | 2.8MB          | 2.8MB           | < 1.0-1.5MB ideal      |
| Requests (avg)                   | 62             | 62              | < 30-40 recommended    |

### Primary Bottlenecks & Issues

- **Uncompressed, unoptimized images; missing lazy-loading**
- **Large/unused CSS and JS; not minified/deferred**
- **Render-blocking resources**
- **No CDN or proper HTTP cache headers**
- **TTFB high (~0.8s); backend or hosting improvements possible**
- **Tap targets/navigation not optimized for touch/mobiles**

### Recommendations

1. **High Priority**
   - Compress all images, use .webp/modern formats, implement lazy-loading.
   - Minify and code-split JS/CSS, remove unused styles/scripts, defer non-critical resources.
   - Move critical CSS in head, defer the rest.
   - Set proper cache-control on assets; deploy a CDN for global/static files.
   - Reserve space for images/ads to fix CLS.
2. **Medium Priority**
   - Optimize touch targets and mobile layouts.
   - Reduce/async third-party scripts.
   - Preload/kern fonts, avoid FOIT/FOUT.
3. **Ongoing**
   - Weekly automated Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals testing.
   - Monitor asset sizes and uptime.
