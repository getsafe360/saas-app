# Web Audit Report for https://becoss.de/
**Timestamp:** October 2023

---

## 1. SSL/TLS Configuration
The website is secured with HTTPS, which is a positive aspect for data integrity and privacy. However, it is necessary to evaluate the SSL/TLS configuration for vulnerabilities:
- **Tools Recommended:** Utilize [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to assess the server security.
- **Key Checks:** Confirm the server does not support weak protocols (TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0) and avoid weak cipher suites.

## 2. Security Headers
The security headers play a crucial role in mitigating security risks:
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Currently, there is no CSP header configured. Implementing a CSP is critical to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by controlling source origins.
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Missing; it is recommended to add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing attacks.
- **X-Frame-Options:** Absent; the implementation of either `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` is necessary to prevent clickjacking.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Not configured. HSTS is essential to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks and enforce secure connections.
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Missing; the header `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` should be implemented to protect against XSS attacks.

## 3. Open Ports and Services
It is important to minimize the attack surface:
- **Recommendation:** Conduct a port scan to identify any unnecessary open ports. Ensure only essential services are running, and disable any that are not required.

## 4. Software and Library Vulnerabilities
Keeping the software stack updated is vital for web application security:
- **Review Required:** Assess backend technologies, including the web server and third-party libraries. Ensure all software is updated with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 5. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Improper CORS configuration can expose the server to unauthorized access:
- **Action Needed:** Review CORS settings to ensure that only trusted domains can access the resources, preventing potential cross-origin attacks.

## 6. Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data must be safeguarded effectively:
- **Security Check:** Ensure no sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database strings) is exposed in client-side code. All forms collecting sensitive data need to be secured and use HTTPS.

## 7. Error Handling
Error messages can inadvertently provide valuable information to attackers:
- **Implementation Suggestion:** Modify error handling procedures to display generic error messages instead of detailed system information. This will aid in reducing information disclosure to potential attackers.

## 8. Regular Vulnerability Scannings and Penetration Tests
Ongoing security assessments are essential:
- **Recommendation:** Schedule regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to detect and address potential new vulnerabilities as the application evolves.

## Conclusion
The mentioned recommendations will significantly strengthen the security posture of https://becoss.de/. Regular monitoring and timely updates are paramount to maintaining security and protecting against emerging threats.
