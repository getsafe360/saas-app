# Security Audit Report for https://www.selbstwertakademie.com/
**Timestamp:** [Current Date and Time]

## Introduction
This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive security analysis conducted on the website https://www.selbstwertakademie.com/. The assessment focused on identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could jeopardize the site's security posture.

---

## Module-Wise Summary

### 1. Missing Security Headers
The analysis revealed the absence of several crucial security headers:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header is missing, which allows MIME type sniffing. It is recommended to add:
  ```
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  ```
- **X-XSS-Protection**: The lack of this header means the site lacks basic protections against XSS attacks. To enhance security, implement:
  ```
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  ```
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Without a configured CSP header, the site is particularly vulnerable to XSS and data injection attacks. A robust CSP should be established to mitigate these risks.
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: The website does not enforce HSTS, critical for preventing downgrade attacks. Adding the following is recommended:
  ```
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
  ```
- **Referrer-Policy**: Absence of this header may expose user data. Implementing a policy such as:
  ```
  Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
  ```
  can improve privacy.

### 2. Vulnerable JavaScript Libraries
The source code review identified outdated JavaScript libraries, including versions of jQuery known for vulnerabilities such as XSS. It is imperative to update all libraries to their latest stable versions to diminish security risks.

### 3. Open Redirects
Certain redirect mechanisms were identified, which can potentially allow attackers to direct users to malicious websites. It is essential to audit these functionalities to ensure robust validation of redirect targets.

### 4. SSL/TLS Configuration
The server currently supports SSLv3 and has other deprecated protocols enabled. Updating the server configuration to limit support solely to modern protocols like TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3, while disabling older versions, is critical for maintaining secure communications.

### 5. Potential Information Disclosure
The analysis found that directory listings were enabled on certain paths, risking exposure of sensitive file structures. The server configuration should be updated to disallow directory listings to mitigate this risk.

### 6. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy
A lack of a defined CORS policy can lead to vulnerabilities associated with cross-origin attacks. A well-structured CORS policy should be established to limit which origins are allowed to interact with the site's resources.

### 7. Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints
Observations indicate an absence of rate limiting on authentication endpoints, leaving the site vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Implementing rate limiting can significantly reduce this threat.

## Conclusion
To improve the security posture of https://www.selbstwertakademie.com/, it is crucial to address the identified vulnerabilities. Recommendations include implementing missing security headers, updating JavaScript libraries, configuring SSL/TLS protocols, securing server settings, and establishing a clearly defined CORS policy. Regular reviews and audits of security practices are also advisable to maintain an effective defense against potential threats.
