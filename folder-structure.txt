Hi Claude,

Here’s everything you requested to get started:

package.json – Included below for dependency overview

Folder structure – See attached tree view for current layout

Key components/pages – I’ve highlighted the main ones we’ve built so far

CrewAI config – Included to show how our agents are set up

Let me know if you need access to specific files or credentials. Once you’ve reviewed, feel free to begin implementing the MVP features and technical setup.

Excited to see what you build!

Best, Frank
