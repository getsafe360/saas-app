            Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the getsafe360.com website (the "Service") operated by GetSafe 360 Ltd. ("we", "us", or "our"). These Terms govern your access to and use of the Service, including the conditions under which you may purchase and receive access to GPLv2-licensed software products.
            </p>
            <ol className="text-base py-4 sm:py-6 lg:py-8"> <li>Acceptance of Terms: By accessing or using the Service, or by purchasing or downloading any software product from GetSafe 360, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our End-User License Agreement ("EULA"), and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Service or access any product.</li> <li>Access Contract for GPL Software: Our products may be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 ("GPLv2"). Nothing in these Terms restricts your rights under the GPLv2 once you have lawfully received the software. </li> <li>However, access to GPLv2-licensed software products distributed by GetSafe 360, including the Analizer and Optimizer, is gated behind a commercial contract. By purchasing access, you are entering into a binding agreement that governs:</li> <li>Who may receive and use the product,</li> <li>The business purpose for which it is obtained,</li> <li>The scope of acceptable access and deployment,</li> <li>Enforcement rights in the event of abuse.</li> <li> You may only access our software through this Service if you agree to the following conditions: </li> <li>You represent that the software will be used only for websites that you or your organization directly own and operate.</li> <li>You may not purchase access on behalf of hosting providers, clients, customers, or third parties without an enterprise agreement.</li> <li>Any use of our access-gated software for mass distribution, automated services, or commercial deployment across unrelated websites constitutes a breach of this access agreement, regardless of GPLv2 rights.</li><li>Purchases and Distribution Terms: Purchases made via the Service form part of this access agreement. GetSafe 360 reserves the right to deny, cancel, or revoke any transaction if we suspect that the purchase is intended to bypass enterprise-level licensing or otherwise violates our access policy.</li> <li>Commercial Use Restriction: Hosting companies, managed service providers, digital agencies, and entities offering customer migration or deployment services must not use GPLv2-licensed software accessed through this Service without a signed enterprise agreement. Such entities must contact GetSafe 360 for appropriate licensing terms.</li> <li>Monitoring and Enforcement: GetSafe 360 reserves the right to: </li> <li>Audit usage to verify compliance with access terms,</li> <li>Revoke access and disable license keys or support where misuse is detected,</li> <li>Pursue legal remedies for breach of access terms, including damages based on unauthorized usage at commercial scale.</li><li>Termination: We may terminate or suspend your access at any time for breach of these Terms or our access conditions. Termination does not affect your rights under the GPLv2 with respect to the software you have already received, but it does bar any further access to updates, support, or new versions.</li> <li>Indemnification: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GetSafe 360 from any claim or dispute arising from your misuse of software acquired through this Service, or violation of these Terms.</li> <li>Limitation of Liability: GetSafe 360 shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages related to use of the Service. Our maximum liability under this agreement shall not exceed the amount paid by you for access.</li> <li>Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. Any disputes shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Delaware.</li> <li>Changes to Terms: We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of any modified Terms.</li> <li>Privacy: Use of our website and services is subject to our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference.</li> </ol>
