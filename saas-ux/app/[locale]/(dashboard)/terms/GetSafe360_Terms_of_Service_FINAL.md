Confidential information does not include information that is publicly available, independently developed, or received from a third party without confidentiality obligations. Either party may disclose confidential information if required by law or court order, provided that the disclosing party provides prompt notice to allow the other party to seek protective measures.

## 16. Force Majeure

The Company will not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations under these Terms that results from causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, government action, or failure of telecommunications or utility services. The Company will use reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as practicable.

## 17. Changes to These Terms

The Company may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated to you via email or through the Service at least 30 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service following notice of changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not accept the modified Terms, you must discontinue use of the Service.

## 18. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

### 18.1 Informal Resolution

Before initiating formal proceedings, you and the Company agree to attempt to resolve any dispute through good-faith negotiation. Either party may initiate this process by sending written notice to the other party describing the dispute and proposing a resolution.

### 18.2 Arbitration

If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of written notice, you and the Company agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator or arbitration organization. The arbitration will be conducted in English under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Each party will bear its own costs, and the parties will share the arbitrator's fees equally. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially and the award will be final and binding.

### 18.3 Class Action Waiver

You and the Company agree that any arbitration or court proceeding will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action, collective action, or representative action. You waive the right to participate in any class action against the Company.

You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to the Company within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. The notice must include your name, address, email, and a clear statement that you are opting out of the arbitration agreement.

### 18.5 Exception

Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm or to enforce intellectual property rights.

## 19. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If arbitration is not pursued, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in Dublin, Ireland.

## 20. Notices

Any notices required under these Terms may be sent by email to the email address associated with your account or to the Company at legal@getsafe360.ai. Notices sent by email are effective when sent. You are responsible for maintaining current contact information.

## 21. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements you enter into with the Company, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Service. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The Company's failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

## 22. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if such modification is not possible, the provision will be severed. The remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## 23. Waiver

No waiver of any provision of these Terms is effective unless in writing and signed by the Company. The Company's failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision, and does not prevent the Company from enforcing that right or provision in the future.

## 24. Assignment

The Company may assign these Terms or any of its rights or obligations under these Terms to any successor or affiliate without notice or your consent. You may not assign these Terms or any of your rights or obligations without the Company's prior written consent.

## 25. Limitation on Claims
